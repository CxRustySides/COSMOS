I"ë<p>Onward to COSMOS 4.4.1!   27 tickets have been incorporated including 6 new features, 13 bug fixes and 8 general maintenance changes.</p>

<p>Mainly a stability bug fix release, but there are a few cool changes.  There is an new keyword for marking that bit overlaps are intentional in packet definition files.  This can get rid of those annoying warnings when you do this intentionally.  There is also a new DELETE_ITEM keyword to get rid of items potentially added by auto generation.   Tlm Extractor and Tlm Grapher can now pull more than 10,000 data points from DART.   Also, there is now the ability to package multiple targets into one gem.</p>

<p>Enjoy and see below for the full list of changes.</p>

<h3 id="migration-notes-from-cosmos-430">Migration Notes from COSMOS 4.3.0:</h3>

<p>To upgrade to the latest version of COSMOS, run ‚Äúbundle update cosmos‚Äù in your COSMOS project folder.</p>

<p>The faster identification in ticket #911 does come with a potentially breaking change.  The improvement requires that all packets for a given target be identified using the same fields (bit offset, bit_size, and type).   This is the typical configuration, and breaking this pattern is typically a dangerous/bad choice for interfaces anyways, but previously COSMOS did default to handling packets being potentially identified using different fields in the same target.  If you have a target that still requires that functionality, you need to declare CMD_UNIQUE_ID_MODE, and/or TLM_UNIQUE_ID_MODE in the target‚Äôs target.txt file to indicate it should use the slower identification method.</p>
