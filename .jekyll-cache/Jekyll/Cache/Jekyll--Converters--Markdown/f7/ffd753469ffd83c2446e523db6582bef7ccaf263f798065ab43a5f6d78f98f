I"ñ<p>Ball Aerospace COSMOS has been featured in a blog post on <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/news/2022">SparkFun</a>. SparkFun is an online retail store that sells electronics primarily for hobbyists. Ball recently purchased a Raspberry Pi, Arduino, and various other parts to interface to COSMOS. We think hobbyists will find COSMOS a great way to interface to their embedded projects and SparkFun agrees! <a href="http://cosmosrb.com/docs/installation">Get started</a> with COSMOS now!</p>

<p>A Ball engineer wrote a <a href="https://bitbucket.org/dholshouser/alagna/wiki/HowTo">Wiki</a> on how he configured COSMOS to talk to his Arduino Uno. Itâ€™s a little old but it gives a nice step by step tutorial on how to use COSMOS with an Arduino.</p>
