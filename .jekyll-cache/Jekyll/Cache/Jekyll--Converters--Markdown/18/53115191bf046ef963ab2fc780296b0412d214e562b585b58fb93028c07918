I"§<p>Ball Aerospace COSMOS has been featured in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnWXOAplvjY&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=9m">presentation</a> by Chris Heistand from <a href="http://www.jhuapl.edu/">John Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory</a>. Heâ€™s working on the <a href="http://dart.jhuapl.edu/">Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART)</a> not to be confused with COSMOS <a href="/docs/dart_overview">DART</a>. They have setup COSMOS to run in a Docker container which X fowards to a X11Server VNC container which they then use a VNC Client to connect to. Pretty cool stuff which we we will hopefully have more out of the box support for in the future. Stay tuned!</p>
