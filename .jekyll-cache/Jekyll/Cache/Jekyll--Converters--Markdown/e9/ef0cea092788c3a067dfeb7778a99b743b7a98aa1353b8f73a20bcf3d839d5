<h3 id="migration-notes-from-cosmos-430">Migration Notes from COSMOS 4.3.0:</h3>

<p>To upgrade to the latest version of COSMOS, run “bundle update cosmos” in your COSMOS project folder.</p>

<p>The faster identification in ticket #911 does come with a potentially breaking change.  The improvement requires that all packets for a given target be identified using the same fields (bit offset, bit_size, and type).   This is the typical configuration, and breaking this pattern is typically a dangerous/bad choice for interfaces anyways, but previously COSMOS did default to handling packets being potentially identified using different fields in the same target.  If you have a target that still requires that functionality, you need to declare CMD_UNIQUE_ID_MODE, and/or TLM_UNIQUE_ID_MODE in the target’s target.txt file to indicate it should use the slower identification method.</p>
